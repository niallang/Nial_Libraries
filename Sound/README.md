# SOUND AND MUSIC


This work was contributed by Stuart Smith. It is a conversion from a MATLAB
toolkit.

Full documentation of the routines in *sound_new.ndf* is contained in the file
**NialSound.pdf**.


These demos illustrate the use of routines contained in *sound_new.ndf*,
which is a collection of ops to create and manipulate sound and music.
Each demo is free-standing. Just loaddefs it and it will run by itself.
The routines available in *sound_new.ndf* are described below

Each demo is self-contained. Just run the demo using *nial -defs <demo>*.
