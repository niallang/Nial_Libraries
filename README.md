# The Nial Libraries Repository

The main repository for official Nial Libraries, some of which are maintained by the community.

This repository contains:
- `NialTk`: Tcl/Tk bindings
- `Sound`: Audio manipulation library
- `Unicode/niallib/`: Unicode library and helper functions

## How To Use
The instructions for each library are given in their folders.

The common method of importing a library is using `loaddefs 'path/to/file.ndf'` for all required library files.
